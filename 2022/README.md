# Solutions to Advent of Code challenges

These are my solutions to the advent of code challenges. They are probably not very efficient or tidy, but they get the right answers :)

Answers are calculated using tests

## Setup and run

In case you're not familiar with Ruby, to run the tests you need to do the following:

* Install Ruby (3.0 or greater - current stable is 3.0.3)
* Run `gem install bundler`
  * This is a package manager, similar to pip, npm, etc
* In the repository root folder, run `bundle install` to install dependencies
* Run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests
